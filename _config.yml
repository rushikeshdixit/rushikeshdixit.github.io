additionalinfo: |
   <strong>Software Development</strong>: Worked on Android projects with API Integration through Gradle build. Java Projects for concurrency control to run FTP commands. Compiler Construction using Scala through Maven build for a small language called Simple Programming Language (SPL). <br/><br/>
   <strong>Web Development</strong>: My server side web development experience has largely been based on the Python Flask framework and somewhat using Express.js. I have also worked with some client side technology, having used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, Javascript and have also experimented with other interesting technologies such as Angular5.<br/><br/>
  #  <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with SVN, Git, Maven, Gradle, Sonar and Jenkins. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
